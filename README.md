# Artify
Many artists seem to struggle with promoting their art, this platform help artists to share their work with art enthusiasts. Artify is all built in JS, using express for backend Api, React for the frontend and React Native for the mobile App.

Special Thanks to [Daniela Castro](https://www.behance.net/danicastro) incredible art designer(and my girlfriend :D) who made the login page [artwork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosfrodrigues/Artify/master/frontend/src/assets/art.png).

## How to run:
At first, you will need [node, npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [expo](https://expo.io/) installed in your computer.

Second step: install dependencies, run in each folder(backend, frontend, mobile):
```
npm install
````

run this inside the frontend and backend folder:
``` 
npm start
```

for the mobile app you need to put your IP in the file mobile/src/config.js and run inside the mobile folder:
``` 
expo start
```
